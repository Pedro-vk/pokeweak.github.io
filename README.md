#Pokeweak for web
Welcome to Pokeweak web version.
I'm not a frontend and backend developer, for this reason the code and the web have a lot of issues... I'm working to fix them, sorry for that.

###v.1 Roadmap
- [X] Static web
- [ ] Dinamic web
- [ ] Code refactor
- [ ] Add smooth animations for mobile devices
- [ ] Add more information about the Pok√©mon list
- [ ] Something else? Any idea?
